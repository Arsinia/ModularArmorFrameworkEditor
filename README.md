Simple GUI editor for the definition json of the Modular Armor Framework (https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/810)

Uses Python 3.11 and TKinterBootstrap. Look at PipFreeze.txt for exact dependencies.

You can run the Python script directly if you have the dependencies but in releases there is a version compiled into a .exe file.

If you care about your computer's security I HIGHLY recommend you build this yourself or run the script directly rather than just downloading the exe. If you get something like Pycharm (which is free) it's super easy to set up and build. Once you have the dependencies set up, you can just run build.bat and it'll pretty much do everything for you. it's best to avoid running other people's .exe files whenever you can.
